In this project, I worked as a Junior Data Engineer for Gans, a company focused on improving urban mobility with an e-scooter-sharing system in major cities worldwide. Gans’ main challenge, however, is ensuring optimal distribution of e-scooters based on daily commuting patterns, weather conditions, and tourist influxes.

To address these challenges, I recognized the importance of data-driven insights and predictive modelling. The steps involved in this project includes:
Local pipeline: Data Collection (Web scrapping, API), Data Storage (SQL Database)
Cloud pipeline: CGP MySQL, Cloud Function and Cloud Scheduler
